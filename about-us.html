       <p class="about-me-rows">Welcome to my landing page. A quick about me I'm a powerlifter who enjoys painting as hobbie who also loves cars & technology.
         I have a small family that have inspired me to try new things.
         My coding journey started 5 years where I was playing with code for fun but never really built anything. This intrigue dates back to myspace.
         I've spent my 20's working from retail to the oil industry. Now entering my 30's I've decided to switch careers and hope to have more physical energy to focus on weight lifting and family.
